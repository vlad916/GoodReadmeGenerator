# GOOD README GENERATOR


This project is about making a program using node.js in the terminal that 
outputs a readme.md file. Having a quality readme file is very important where all the information 
about the app are stored. What the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.
